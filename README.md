I’m Ana, a data enthusiast with a Computer Science background and hands-on experience in Data Science.

I earned my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and recently sharpened my skills through an intensive Data Science program, where I practiced data preparation, exploratory analysis, building models, and deploying them into real use cases.

Proficient in Python, SQL, and PostgreSQL, I’m passionate about uncovering insights from data and transforming them into impactful solutions.

I’m eager to join a collaborative team where I can contribute to meaningful, data-driven projects while continuing to grow and expand my expertise.

Feel free to connect with me!
